# Specification Quality Checklist: Vevor Diesel Heater Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items passed on first validation. Specification is ready for planning phase.

## Notes

- Specification includes 5 user stories prioritized P1 (core) to P3 (enhancement)
- All 20 functional requirements are testable and clear
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios (manual control conflicts, proxy limits, multiple heaters)
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused (time-based, percentage-based)
- Assumptions document prerequisites without constraining implementation
